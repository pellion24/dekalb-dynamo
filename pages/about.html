    <h2 class="large-text">We are a grassroots soccer team based out of the North DeKalb Area!</h2>
    <p>We had the goal of finding a space for us and our friends to play <strong>competitive</strong> and
        <strong>fast-paced</strong> soccer during the summer. After some recruiting and hard-work,
    we started our first ever competitive season with the ADASL, and had our first match on June 1st, 2025.</p>
    <p>Our vision is to grow DeKalb Dynamo from just a men's Sunday-League team into a proper grassroots club,
    with teams in multiple leagues within the Metro Atlanta soccer scene.</p>
